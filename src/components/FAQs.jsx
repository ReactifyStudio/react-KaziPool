What does it cost to hire with KaziPool?
KaziPool is completely free for workers. We only charge clients a small commission to cover running the platform and service, 
including covering all the transactions costs. 
This is currently only 10%. There isn’t any VAT on the KaziPool's payment, but we have to add VAT to the platform fee.

Our fees are completely transparent, unlike agencies who hide their fees in an overall higher day rate, 
and sometimes get away with as much as double in the hidden mark-up! For more information see: Platform Fees



Why use KaziPool to manage the job?
KaziPool is the most secure way to find and hire temp workers online. All conversations are secure and recorded, 
without having to give-out your contact details.

You get a work agreement with details agreed and document up-front, to help avoid any disagreement later. 
Worker ID is verified so they are traceable through their bank details. Payment is cashless and secure.

You also get to review workers to keep them keen, or to post an honest review if they don’t do a good job. 
Finally our team is on hand to help with any issues.
